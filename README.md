# Bevy + D-Bus Demo

This Rust project demonstrates the integration of the **Bevy** game engine with **D-Bus** (Desktop Bus) communication.  
It shows how to connect a real-time Bevy application with system-level or session-level services over D-Bus, enabling interaction between graphical/game components and external system events or services.
